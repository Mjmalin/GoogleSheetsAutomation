# VeoSheetsAutomation

This program was made for the micromobility company Veo. It automates a time-consuming task in Google Sheets for their supply chain.

## The Problem

Each month, the Veo Central Warehouse Lead Manager has to print the parts list (and parts labels) every market location needs. There could be up to 70 parts lists and labels to print.

For each market, this entails:
Manually updating the market location and central warehouse location in Google Sheets, waiting for the sheet to update.
Selecting the section of the sheet to print
Copy/pasting the info needed for parts labels into another sheet
Selecting the section of that sheet to print
